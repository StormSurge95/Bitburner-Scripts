# Bitburner-Scripts
Just a simple repository of scripts for use within the open-source game Bitburner<br/>
https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812820/Bitburner/

# Liability
There is absolutely NO guarantee that these scripts will do what they are meant to do. My only guarantee is that they work for ME the way I intend for them to (outside of the few that may or may not need some slight improvements). lol

# License
I have no idea how to do licenses for code; but basically I give anyone and everyone permission to use these scripts as they see fit with only one exception:
I prohibit the commercial use of these scripts.

Do you want to copy these scripts and use them in your client for bitburner? Have at it.
Do you see some algorithm within my scripts that you can use elsewhere just for fun? By all means.
But please do not take my script and then copy it and make money off of selling it to someone else; because that would just be wrong.
